                <p class="meaning">
                    To understand the meaning of design is...<br>
                    to understand the part form and content play...and to realize that design is also
                    commentary, opinion, a point of view, and social responsibility. To design is much
                    more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit; it is to add value and 
                    meaning,to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize,
                    to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse. Design is both a verb and a noun. It is the
                    beginning as well as the end, the process and product of imagination.

            <p class="text2">
                Typography design is the art of arranging a message in a readable and aesthetically
                pleasing composition. It' is an integral element of design. Typography doesn't ask
                the designer to draw their own letterforms, but to instead work with typefaces that
                already exist.
