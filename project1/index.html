                <p class="text1">A computer's functions and features can be broken down into
                    three basic tasks all computers perform: input, processing, and 
                    output. Information is input to a computer from a device such as
                    keyboard of from storage device such as hard drive; the central
                    processing unit (CPU) processes the information, and then output
                    is usually created.
                    An <strong>operating system (OS)</strong> is a specialized computer
                    program that provides the following features:

                    <li>
                        <i>User interface</i>&mdash;The <strong>user interface</strong> provides a
                        method for users to interact with the computer, usually with a keyboard
                        and mouse or touch screen. A user clicks, touches, or types; the computer
                        processes the input and provides some type of output.

                    <li>
                        <i>File system</i>&mdash;The <strong>file system</strong> is the method by which
                        an OS stores and organizes files and manages access to files on a storage device,
                        such as a hard drive.

                        <i>Processes and services</i>&mdash;A <strong>process</strong> is a program that's 
                        loaded into memory and run by the CPU. It can be an application a user interacts
                        with, such as a word-processing program or a Web browser, or a program with no 
                        user interface that communicates with and provides services to other processes.
                        This type of process is usually called a <strong>service</strong> in Windows and a 
                        <i>daemon</i> in Linux, and is said to run in the background because there's no user
                        interface.

                        with the highest priority. It schedules processes<br> to run, making sure high-priority
                        processes are taken care of first; manages memory to ensure that two<br> applications don't
                        attempt to use the same memory space; and makes sure I/O devices are accessed by<br> only
                        one process at a time, in addition to other tasks.

                <h3>The Central Processing Unit</h3>
                <p class="text2">
                    The CPU is the chip that performs the actual computational and logic work.
                    Most modern PCs have one such chip, and are referred to as <strong>single-processor computers</strong>. 
                    In reality, to ensure complete functionality,the CPU requires several support chips, such as chips that
                    help manage communication with devices and device drivers.
                    Chip technology continues to develop with the addition of multicore processors.
                    A processor <strong>core</strong> is the part of the CPU that reads and executes basic instrucions, such
                    as reading and writing data from and to memory or executing an arithmetic operation. CPUs were originally
                    created to have only one core and thus perform only one instruction at a time. A multicore processor has two
                    or more cores&mdash;for exmaple, a dual-core processor contains two cores and a quad-core processor has four. 
                    The most processor cores used in a traditional PC desktops and servers is 16 as of this writing, but high-end 
                    CPUs, such as Intel's Knights Landing, have up to 72 cores. Development continues in this area, and scientists
                    so far have put as many as 1000 cores on a single CPU chip.

                <p><strong class="basic">Basic CPU Architecture</strong></p>
                <p class="text2">Most CPUs are composed of the following elements:</p>

                <ul class="list2">
                    <li>
                        <i>Control unit</i>&mdash;The <strong>control unit (CU)</strong> is the director of operations
                        in the CPU. The control unit provides timing and cordination between the other parts of the CPU, such
                        as the arithmetic logic unit, registers, and system bus. For example, when a new instruction should be
                        executed, the control unit receives and decodes the instruction and tells the arithmetic logic unit to
                        execute it.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>Arithmetic logic unit</i>&mdash;The <strong>arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</strong> performs the
                        primary task of any CPU, which is to execute instructions. These might be arithmetic instructions, such
                        as addition or multiplication of integers, or logic instructions, such as binary AND or binary OR 
                        instructions. Most CPUs also contain a <strong>floating point unit (FPU)</strong> that performs floating
                        point operations.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>Registers</i>&mdash;A <strong>register</strong> is a temporary holding location on a CPU where data
                        must be placed before the CPU can use it. There are instruction registers that hold the instruction the CPU
                        executes, such as add, multiply, or store. Also, the CPU uses address registers to access data stored in RAM,
                        and data registers that hold the data the CPU is currently working with, such as two numbers used in an add
                        or multiply instruction.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>System bus</i>&mdash;The system bus is a series of lanes that are used to communicate between the
                        CPU and other major parts of the computer, such as RAM and input/output (I/O) devices. There are actually
                        three types of buses: the control bus,address bus, and data bus. The <strong>control bus</strong> carries
                        status signal between the CPU and other devices. Status signals inform the CPU that a device needs attention;
                        for example, when an input device has data ready, the CPU must execute the device driver code to read the
                        data from the device. The <strong>address bus</strong> carries address signals to indicate where data should
                        be read from or written to in the system's memory. The <strong>data bus</strong> carries actual data that is
                        being read from or written to the system memory.
