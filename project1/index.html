                <h2>Operating Systems Fundamentals</h2>
                <p><strong class="intro">An Introduction to Operating Systems</strong></p>
                <p>A computer's functions and features can be broken down into
                    three basic tasks all computers perform: input, processing, and 
                    output. Information is input to a computer from a device such as
                    keyboard of from storage device such as hard drive; the central
                    processing unit (CPU) processes the information, and then output
                    is usually created.
                    An <strong>operating system (OS)</strong> is a specialized computer
                    program that provides the following features:
                </p>

                <ul class="list1">
                    <li>
                        <i>User interface</i>&mdash;The <strong>user interface</strong> provides a
                        method for users to interact with the computer, usually with a keyboard
                        and mouse or touch screen. A user clicks, touches, or types; the computer
                        processes the input and provides some type of output.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>File system</i>&mdash;The <strong>file system</strong> is the method by which
                        an OS stores and organizes files and manages access to files on a storage device,
                        such as a hard drive.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>Processes and services</i>&mdash;A <strong>process</strong> is a program that's 
                        loaded into memory and run by the CPU. It can be an application a user interacts
                        with, such as a word-processing program or a Web browser, or a program with no 
                        user interface that communicates with and provides services to other processes.
                        This type of process is usually called a <strong>service</strong> in Windows and a 
                        <i>daemon</i> in Linux, and is said to run in the background because there's no user
                        interface.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>Kernel</i>&mdash;The <strong>Kernel</strong> is the heart of the OS and runs 
                        with the highest priority. It schedules processes<br> to run, making sure high-priority
                        processes are taken care of first; manages memory to ensure that two<br> applications don't
                        attempt to use the same memory space; and makes sure I/O devices are accessed by<br> only
                        one process at a time, in addition to other tasks.
                    </li>
