                <p class="text1">A computer's functions and features can be broken down into
                    three basic tasks all computers perform: input, processing, and 
                    output. Information is input to a computer from a device such as
                    keyboard of from storage device such as hard drive; the central
                    processing unit (CPU) processes the information, and then output
                    is usually created.
                    An <strong>operating system (OS)</strong> is a specialized computer
                    program that provides the following features:

                        method for users to interact with the computer, usually with a keyboard
                        and mouse or touch screen. A user clicks, touches, or types; the computer

                        with, such as a word-processing program or a Web browser, or a program with no 
                        user interface that communicates with and provides services to other processes.
                        This type of process is usually called a <strong>service</strong> in Windows and a 
                        <i>daemon</i> in Linux, and is said to run in the background because there's no user

                <p class="text2">
                    The CPU is the chip that performs the actual computational and logic work.
                    Most modern PCs have one such chip, and are referred to as <strong>single-processor computers</strong>. 
                    In reality, to ensure complete functionality,the CPU requires several support chips, such as chips that
                    help manage communication with devices and device drivers.
                    Chip technology continues to develop with the addition of multicore processors.
                    A processor <strong>core</strong> is the part of the CPU that reads and executes basic instrucions, such
                    as reading and writing data from and to memory or executing an arithmetic operation. CPUs were originally
                    created to have only one core and thus perform only one instruction at a time. A multicore processor has two
                    or more cores&mdash;for exmaple, a dual-core processor contains two cores and a quad-core processor has four. 
                    The most processor cores used in a traditional PC desktops and servers is 16 as of this writing, but high-end 
                    CPUs, such as Intel's Knights Landing, have up to 72 cores. Development continues in this area, and scientists
                    so far have put as many as 1000 cores on a single CPU chip.

                <p><strong class="basic">Basic CPU Architecture</strong></p>
                <p class="text2">Most CPUs are composed of the following elements:</p>

                <ul class="list2">
                    <li>
                        <i>Control unit</i>&mdash;The <strong>control unit (CU)</strong> is the director of operations
                        in the CPU. The control unit provides timing and cordination between the other parts of the CPU, such
                        as the arithmetic logic unit, registers, and system bus. For example, when a new instruction should be
                        executed, the control unit receives and decodes the instruction and tells the arithmetic logic unit to
                        execute it.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>Arithmetic logic unit</i>&mdash;The <strong>arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</strong> performs the
                        primary task of any CPU, which is to execute instructions. These might be arithmetic instructions, such
                        as addition or multiplication of integers, or logic instructions, such as binary AND or binary OR 
                        instructions. Most CPUs also contain a <strong>floating point unit (FPU)</strong> that performs floating
                        point operations.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <i>Registers</i>&mdash;A <strong>register</strong> is a temporary holding location on a CPU where data
                        must be placed before the CPU can use it. There are instruction registers that hold the instruction the CPU
                        executes, such as add, multiply, or store. Also, the CPU uses address registers to access data stored in RAM,
                        and data registers that hold the data the CPU is currently working with, such as two numbers used in an add
                        or multiply instruction.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>System bus</i>&mdash;The system bus is a series of lanes that are used to communicate between the
                        CPU and other major parts of the computer, such as RAM and input/output (I/O) devices. There are actually
                        three types of buses: the control bus,address bus, and data bus. The <strong>control bus</strong> carries
                        status signal between the CPU and other devices. Status signals inform the CPU that a device needs attention;
                        for example, when an input device has data ready, the CPU must execute the device driver code to read the
                        data from the device. The <strong>address bus</strong> carries address signals to indicate where data should
                        be read from or written to in the system's memory. The <strong>data bus</strong> carries actual data that is
                        being read from or written to the system memory.

                <h2>Cloud Computing Fundamentals</h2>
                <p class="text3">
                    <strong>Cloud computing</strong> is a networking model in which data, applications, and processing power are managed
                    by servers on the Internet; users of these resources pay for what they use rather than for the equipment and software 
                    needed to provide resources. It's like paying only for cell phone minutes you use instead of paying for the towers and 
                    switching equipment needed to make your phone work.
                    The word <i>cloud</i> is used to obscure the details of equipment and software that actually provide resources. For the
                    most part, customers don't care whether equipment consists of Windows or Linux servers, large tower computers, or rack-
                    mounted computers, as long it works.
                    For many companies, cloud computing's allure is based on the following benefits: reduced physical plant cost, recude upfront
                    cost, and reduced personnel costs.
                    Although cloud computing has seemingly limitless applications, three main categories of cloud computing have taken center stage:
                </p>

                <ul class="list3">
                    <li>Software as a service</li>
                    <li>Platform as a service</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure as a service</li>
                </ul><!--End of services-->

                <p class="text3">
                    The prhase <i>as a service</i> simply means that the resource resides on another server or network
                    than the one using the resource, and customers use it as a paid service. You might also hear the term
                    SPI model, which is based on the combination of the three aforementioned "as a service" terms 
                    (Software, Platform, Infrastructure).
                </p>

                <p class="soft"><strong>Software as a Service</strong></p>
                <p class="text3">
                    <code>Software as a service (SaaS)</code> is also called <i>hosted applications</i> or <i>on-demand applications</i>
                    becasue the customer doesn't actually buy any software that's installed on its own equipment. Instead, the customer
                    pays for the use of applications that run on a service provider's network.The most wellknown examples are Google Apps
                    and Microsoft Office 365.
                </p>

                <p class="plat"><strong>Platform as a Service</strong></p>
                <p class="text3">
                    <code>Platform as a service (PaaS)</code>&mdash;aslo called <i>hosted platform</i>&mdash;is similar to SaaS,
                    but the customer develops aplications with the service provider's tool and infrastructure. After applications
                    are developed, they can be delivered to the customer's users from the provider's servers. This setup differs 
                    from SaaS, in which the service provider owns the applications delivered to users; with PaaS, the customer 
                    develops and owns the application and then delivers it to a third party.
                    The most common PaaS products are Salesforce.com's Apex, Azure for Windows, Google's App Engine for Python 
                    and Java, WaveMaker for Ajax, and Engine Yard for Ruby on Rails.
                </p>

                <p class="infra"><strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong></p>
                <p class="text3">
                    <code>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</code>, or <i>hosted infrastructure</i>, allows companies to use a 
                    vendor's storage or even entire virtual servers as needed. Traditionally, if a company needs another 100GB
                    of storage to house a new database, it has to buy a new hard drive&mdash;assuming the server can accommodate 
                    a new hard drive. By using IaaS, the company simply pays for another 100GB of space without worrying about 
                    how the space is actually provided. In addition, if a customer needs another server to handle its application
                    workload, it simply pays for the amount of processing and storage the additional server actually requires 
                    instead of paying for the physical device. In most cases, IaaS run as virutal machines on more powerful physical
                    servers.

                <p class="text4">
                    A computer <strong>network</strong> consists of two or more computers connected by some kind of transmission
                    medium, such as a cable or airwaves. After they're connected, correctly configured computers can communicate 
                    with one another. The primary motivations for networking are to share resources, such as printers and hard 
                    drives; to share information, such as word-processing files; and to communicate by using applications such as
                    e-mail. These motivations are important, especially for businesses, but another motivating factor for both 
                    businesses and home users is to "get online"&mdash;to access the Internet.

                        <i>Network interface card (NIC)</i>&mdash;A <strong>NIC (pronounced <i>nick</i>)</strong> is an add-on 
                        card that's plugged into a motherboard expansion slot and provides a connection between the computer and the
                        network. Most computers have a NIC built into the motherboard, so an additional card is not necessary.

                    <li>
                        <i>Network medium</i>&mdash;This cable plugs into the NIC and makes the connection between a computer and 
                        the rest of the network. In networks with just two computers, the other end of the cable can plug into the 
                        second computer's NIC. More likely, the other end of the cable plugs into an interconnecting device that 
                        accommodates several computer connections. Network media can also be airwaves, as in wireless networks. In this
                        case, the connection is made between the antenna on the NIC and the antenna on another NIC or interconnecting 
                        device.

                        device, most networks include one or several of these components. They allow computers to communicate on a network
                        without being connected directly. Interconnecting devices include switches, hubs, routers, and wireless access

                    needed to interact with network hardware and communicate with other computers on the network. Network software 
                    transform a stand-alone OS into a network OS. It's the software that allows a word-processing program to open a 
                    document on a server and knows how to request a Web page or send an e-mail. It's also the software that communicates
                    between the OS and network hardware.

                    Network software can be divided into the following:
                </p>

                <ul class="list4">
                    <li>
                        <i>Network clients and servers</i>&mdash;<strong>Network client software</strong> request information that's stored
                        on another network computer or device. <strong>Network server software</strong> allows a computer to share its resources 
                        by responding to resource request generated by network clients. Network client software can be an integral part of 
                        well-known aplications, such as Web browsers and e-mail programs.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>Protocols</i>&mdash;When clients and servers need to send information on the network, they must pass it to 
                        <strong>network protocols</strong>, which define the rules and formats a computer must use when sending information 
                        accross the network. A network protocol can be likened to a human language. Just as two people communicate by speaking
                        the same language, two computers communicate by using the same protocol. An example of a network protocol is <strong>
                        TCP/IP</strong>. Network protocols perform all the behind-the-scenes tasks required to handle networking functions and 
                        most of their complexity.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <i>NIC device driver</i>&mdash;After the network protocol has formatted a message correctly, it hands the data off 
                        to the NIC driver for transmission onto the network. NIC drivers receive data from protocols and then forward it to the 
                        physical NIC, which transmist the data onto the medium. The revese is also true. When data arrives at the NIC from the 
                        medium, the NIC hands it off to the NIC driver, which then hands it off to the network protocols. Every NIC installed 
                        in a computer must have an associated device driver installed in the OS. The device driver software manages the details
                        of communicating wiht the NIC hardware to send data to network media and receive data from it.
